# Halloween-Classification

Computer Vision model using Convolutional Neural Networks to 
classify guest's efforts on their costumes idea and be able to identify weather or not this costumes reaches the 
halloween expectations.  

Plan #1 Retrive image dataset of good and bad halloween coustumes

Plan #2 Identify any bias, be sure to clear any unnecceasry data

Plan #3 Build model -- pending

Plan #4 Train

Plan #5 allow access to camera,  use set weights to allow accurate classification when predicting
